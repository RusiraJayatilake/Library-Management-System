# Library-Management-System
This is a console application built using Java, trying to stimulate a library system.

This project uses I/O activities in Java, it reads data through a text file name 'items'. It contains all the data needed for this library application.
The system consists of several functions like searching items from a list and selecting the searched item.
There are plenty of features that can be implemented in this application and I hope I will add them in near future.
